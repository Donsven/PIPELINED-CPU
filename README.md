# PIPELINED-CPU
Pipelined RISC-V CPU | Hardware project

• Developed a pipelined RISC-V CPU using Scala/Chisel.
• Conducted extensive testing and debugging using SBT, running specific test to verify each stage of the pipeline. 
• Implemented forwarding, branching, and flushing logic for control flow management.
• Additionally added a hazard detection unit to handle bubbles within the pipeline and improve performance.
